# Java-Chess-Game-Implementation
Developed a comprehensive chess game in Java, featuring a complete implementation of chess rules and mechanics. The project includes a fully functional game loop, piece movement logic, and user interface for interaction. This code handles the basic implementation of chess rules, including piece movement, turn management, and game state handling. It also allows for a user-friendly console interface with color-coded output text for visualizing the board and highlighting valid moves to enhancing player interaction. Please note, the class "Main" is the class to actually play and run this chess game.
